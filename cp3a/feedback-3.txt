Nice!

I wonder if data could be organized differently in memory?
So that elements of e.g. row 0 and row 1 would be "interleaved",
so that the innermost loop would basically read just
2 consecutive blocks of memory instead of 4?
Then I think it might be enough to do 2 prefetches instead of 4?
One cache line would contain already 2 vectors.
