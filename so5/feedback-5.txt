There is a bug in the way you use nested parallelism here, and the code creates
way more threads than is needed. You can try this yourself by running
`OMP_NUM_THREADS=100 ./so-benchmark 100000000` and see the code crash. Note that
CPUs with over 100 hardware threads are nowadays commonly available. Instead of
using nested parallelism, you could use one `omp parallel` section in `psort`
and then use `omp task` in recursive calls to `parallel_qsort`.
