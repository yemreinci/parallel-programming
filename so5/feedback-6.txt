I don't think I've seen many parallel partition functions implemented. While it
may give you better cpu utilization, there's also some additional copying needed.
The mixture of nested parallel sections and tasking makes it quite difficult to
reason about the parallelism. For example, in multiple runs of

    strace -c -e trace=clone ./so-benchmark 100000000

the number of threads the solution actually spawned seemed to randomly vary
between 7, 28, 49, and 70.
